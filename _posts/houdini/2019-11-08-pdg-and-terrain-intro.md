# About my goal

This week I wanted to make more tools so that I'd be more familiar with Houdini and its workflow. I always wanted to make a pier tool in whatever program I already worked with. In my opinion, Houdini is the perfect program to make this with. But before I made that tool, I followed a specific tutorial about procedurally modeling a guard tower.
