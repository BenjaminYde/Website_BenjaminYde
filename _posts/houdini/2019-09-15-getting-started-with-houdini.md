# What is Houdini?

In order for studios to achieve great gameplay while meeting deadlines and containing costs, a procedural approach using Houdini offers a smarter way to create quality games. While Houdini has a wide variety of tools designed for generating CG content, it is its node-based procedural workflow that sets it apart because it makes it easier for you to create directable CG shots, explore multiple iterations and refine your work, even deep into production ~ Houdini website
